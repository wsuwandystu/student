## KASM Workspace Setup (Ubuntu Noble / Kali)

Thanks to improvements in the KASM image, getting started is fast and simple.

Open a Terminal

### First-time setup

```bash
mkdir opencs
cd opencs
git clone https://github.com/Open-Coding-Society/student.git
cd student/
./scripts/activate.sh # prompts for Git UID and Personal Email
./scripts/venv.sh
code .
```

---

### Version Checks (Optional)

Open a new Terminal

```bash
python --version
pip --version
ruby -v
bundle -v
gem --version
git config --global --list
```

#### Starting a session to work in VSCode

Open a new Terminal

Each time you open a new Terminal to work, run:

```bash
cd opencs/student
source venv/bin/activate # activate Python virtual environment
code .
```
